# ShiftManagerToCalendar-
This repository contains the code I developed during my first year of studying computer science. The project is meant to simplify the process of adding working shifts from the Shift Organiser app to Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API and Selenium. The program is adapted to the work structure and hours of the workplace where I worked at the time.
